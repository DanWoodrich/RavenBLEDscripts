# RavenBLEDscripts
Scripts to run and process selection table outputs of BLED (band limited energy detectors) from Raven Pro 1.5 (Cornell Lab of Ornithology). Pathing specific to my computer and replicable on Windows OS. Currently runs, combines, averages, and provides summary statistics for Raven Pro 1.5 BLED detectors.
