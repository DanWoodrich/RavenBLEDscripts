Category,Parameter,Value,Description
Signal manipulation,Decimate,y,Script will look if data is decimated and automatically decimate if y. 
Signal manipulation,decimationFactor,8,Decimation factor. Performed iteratively by prime factors. Should be a factor of sampling rate to avoid decimal sampling rate
Signal manipulation,whiten,n,"If y, script will assume data is whitened. Need to manually whiten data with raven and use naming conventions to path correctly. "
Signal manipulation,FO,100,Filter order for ALE (whitening) filter
Signal manipulation,LMS,0.1,LMS step size for ALE (whitening) filter
Signal manipulation,Filtype,Bband,Type of filter being used to whiten signal. Fband filters out narrowband Bband filters out broadband. 
Raven Detectors,spStart,21,start of spread in raven detector preset folder
Raven Detectors,spEnd,41,end of spread in raven detector preset folder
Context sim,greatcallThresh,0.8,level at which rolling score will reset to maxBonus
Context sim,maxBonus,0.05,Maximum bonus level. Same as reset value when greatcallThresh is reached. 
Context sim,goodcallBonus,0.005,increase factor for every call within resonable range (-maxPenalty to greatcallThresh)
Context sim,maxPenalty,-0.35,"same abs value as lowest value for ""good calls"" that give bonus "
Context sim,badcallPenalty,-0.0005,constant decrease every detection below threshold
Detection Processing Spread,grpsize,4,minimum sum of 2s and 1s to be a positive detection
Detection Processing Spread,allowedZeros,2,maximum number of 0s (instances where run doesn't go up with next detection) until considered end of run
Detection Processing Spread,detskip,7,maximum amount of skips to be eligible increase in run
Detection Processing Spread,groupInt,0.35,max time distance for detectors to be considered in like group 
Detection Processing Spread,Maxdur,3.5,max duration of detection
Detection Processing Spread,Mindur,0,min duration of detection 
GS algo,timesepGS,1.2,Time difference for algo to count GS detection as a 1. 
Adaptive Compare,timediffself,0.15,max secs that detections can be apart to be combined within detectors
Adaptive Compare,probdist,0.2,max difference in probability difference to be combined within detectors. Otherwise will only take higher prob detection
